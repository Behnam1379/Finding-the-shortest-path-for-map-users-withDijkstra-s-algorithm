Designed a program  to find the shortest possible route between two points of the city and also estimate the time required for the user to reach the goal and provide online services.
Defined Server, Router, Vertex, Edge classes and used Dijkstra's algorithm for the routing algorithm, which had a relatively good speed.  Designed graphic with matplotlib library.
